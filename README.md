# PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation

This repository contains a TensorFlow 2.0 implementation of the PointNet neural network architecture. It also includes the original implementation from the creators of PointNet.

The purpose of this project was to get an better understanding of the TensorFlow 2.x features. Conider reading the blogpost [3D Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2](https://www.inovex.de/blog/3d-deep-learning-tensorflow-2/), where I describe how I converted PointNet to TF2.0.
